Raid Race is a temporary project name

Card game similar to the game Mille Bornes except in this game you would be racing to defeat a dungeon boss

Instead of miles, you could be dealing damage. First team to deal enough damage to kill the boss wins the round.

Hazards would be what you would expect from a typical MMO raid

Safeties could be epic tank, epic healer, epic AOE DPS, epic DPS... Something like that

Remedies would be the counter part to their hazards
